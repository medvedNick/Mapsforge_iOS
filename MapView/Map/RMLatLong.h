 \brief Specifies a spherical trapezium by northwest and southeast corners, each given as CLLocationCoordinate2D, similar to specifying the corners of a box.
 
 A spherical trapezium is the surface of a sphere or ellipsoid bounded by two meridians and two parallels. Note that in almost all cases, the lengths of the northern and southern sides of the box are different.
